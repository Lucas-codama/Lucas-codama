## Hi there 👋

I'm Lucas, a high school student specializing in Systems Development at COLTEC-UFMG, a technical school linked to the UFMG. 

I am currently an intern at an early-stage startup, working as an AI & Workflow Automation Specialist.

My work focuses on software development and automation. 

Through school and professional experience, I have consistently used tools such as Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, n8n, and the Windows PowerShell terminal, along with other development and automation utilities.
